# KleineGPT

KleineGPT is a minimalistic implementation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, developed using review data crawled from KFC. This project aims to provide a lightweight and accessible implementation of GPT for educational and experimental purposes.

## Features

- **Simple Implementation:** KleineGPT is designed to be easy to understand and modify, making it suitable for learning about transformer-based models.
- **Text Generation:** Utilizing the power of the GPT architecture, KleineGPT can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the input data.
- **Customizable:** Users can experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and training data to fine-tune the model for various tasks.

## Installation

To install KleineGPT, simply clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnOMDev/gpt_architect.git
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data:** Before training the model, prepare your data in the desired format. KleineGPT works best with text data, such as the review data from KFC.
2. **Training:** Use the provided scripts to train the KleineGPT model on your dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.
3. **Generation:** Once trained, you can generate text using the trained model. Simply provide a prompt to the model, and it will generate text based on the learned patterns.

For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the documentation provided in the repository.

## Examples

```python
# Example code snippet demonstrating how to use KleineGPT for text generation

git clone https://github.com/JohnOMDev/gpt_architect.git

cd gpt_architect

# Train the Model
python train.py

# After training a pretrained model will be saved in the folder

# Generate text based on a prompt
# prompt = "I enjoyed the crispy chicken at KFC because"

python test.py "I enjoyed the crispy chicken at KFC because"

```
